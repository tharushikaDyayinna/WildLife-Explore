The Sri Lankan leopard is without doubt a star attraction for wildlife enthusiasts, both local and international. Panthera Pardus Kotiya is a subspecies of leopard that is native to Sri Lanka and is unfortunately classified as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The reasons for the decline in numbers include hunting for trade, fragmentation and of course habitat loss.

<h2>What is the leopard-appeal?</h2>

<p>Why do people travel from all over to catch a glimpse of these solitary animals that mostly hunt alone and enjoy their solitude? It is mainly because they are difficult to spot in the wild and remain elusive, even though Sri Lanka does have small areas across the island, where there are high numbers dwelling. Being able see a leopard or even a swish of its tail, in its natural habitat leaves you with a sense of accomplishment and respect for this nimble beast.

<h2>Characteristics</h2>

<p>
Easily recognisable by its rusty yellow coat with dark spots, the leopard has a tail that is longer than half of its body length, when taken from head to tail. The males are about 30% larger than the females and weigh approximately 170 lb. The Sri Lankan leopard is considered as one of the largest of the subspecies of leopard in the world.
</p>
<h2>Where can they be found in Sri Lanka?</h2>

<p>The best known locations, to find leopards in their natural habitat, in Sri Lanka are of course the Yala National Park and the Wilpattu National Park. While leopards can usually be found in all types of habitat throughout the country, today they are more concentrated in the areas where conservation is most predominant. They tend to be nocturnal creatures but can be spotted in the early morning or late evening hours as well. As mentioned before, they are usually solitary, gliding through the bush area, but during mating season they do hunt in pairs and if a mother has cubs then she can be seen wandering around with the cubs in tow.</p>

<h2>Yala National Park</h2>

<p>Consisting of grassy plains, scrublands, light forests and brackish lagoons, Yala is in the deep south of Sri Lanka. According to research, the Yala National Park contains the highest density of leopard, which is a positive. The park was designated a wildlife sanctuary in 1900, which means the animals can roam around freely without fear. Owing to its varied habitats, the Yala National Park is home to a rich diversity of wildlife that besides the Sri Lankan leopard includes mammals such as elephants, spotted dear, sloth bear, reptiles, amphibians and birds.</p>

<h2>Wilpattu National Park</h2>

<p>The Wilpattu National Park is one of the oldest wildlife parks in Sri Lanka, located on the North Western coast of Sri Lanka. It is also the largest wildlife park in the country. Like Yala, it too has a varying natural habitat with open grasslands, scrublands, cliffs and dense forests. Its defining features are the natural lakes or sand-rimmed water basins referred to as ‘villus’, found all over the park, from which Wilpattu derives its name. The park has a less commercial vibe when compared to the more popular Yala and besides the elusive leopard is home to a large number of wildlife including mammals, reptiles and birds.
